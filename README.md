# Audio
 designed with MOMO 
 
Firmware working process not finished.

Firmware not reviewed. 

Platform for Animal Observation and Manipulation

Supported:
- FN-RM01 MP3/WAV Audio Recorder and Player Module (Website: www.flyrontech.com)

The Project is used to playback and record sounds, target manipulated via pit-tag numbers.
Uses the Audio Module FN-RM01 which handles automatic playback and record files.


An efficient application to monitor and control animal behaviour in wildlife
as well as in laboratory settings

-	Targeted manipulation of 1000 and more individuals
- Pit-tag numbers targeting Playback-Soundfiles or Record-Soundfiles 
- Playback Audio files P001.wav/mp3 up to P005.wav/mp3 over time
- Random Playback Audio files P001.wav/mp3 up to P005.wav/mp3 over time
- Record Audio files R001.wav up to R999.wav over time
- Combined Audio Playback and Record over time
- There are two special IDs:

  "ANY" means there was a transponder detected, but its ID is not listed.

  "UNKNOWN" means that NO transponder could be detected

-	Low power consumption and specific data collection lead to long lasting collection periods
-	Applicable world-wide due to its compatibility with different types of radio clock receivers 
-	Data-transfer to external devices, such as personal computers
- Time Synchronization with atomic clock once a day to ensure optimal data quality
- Application Current Control twice a day
- Forecast for Battery-Change implemented
- Energy Bypass so that Date and Time are maintained even when changing battery
- Hyperterminal Output to get real-time data in the field
