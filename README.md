# Audio
 designed with MOMO

Platform for Animal Observation and Manipulation

Supported:
- FN-RM01 MP3/WAV Audio Recorder and Player Module (Website: www.flyrontech.com)


The Audio is used to playback and record sounds of the animals. It is switched ON or
OFF together with the RFID_Reader. Audio uses the Audio Module FN-RM01
which handles automatic playback and record files. Audio is
powered by one of the Power_Outputs, usually UA2. Use variable
AUDIO_POWER to select the power output.


An efficient application to monitor and control animal behaviour in wildlife
as well as in laboratory settings

-	Targeted manipulation of 1000 and more individuals
- Random Playback Audio files P001.wav/mp3 up to P005.wav/mp3 over time
- Record Audio files R001.wav up to R999.wav over time
- Combined Audio Playback and Record over time
-	Low power consumption and specific data collection lead to long lasting collection periods
-	Applicable world-wide due to its compatibility with different types of radio clock receivers 
-	Data-transfer to external devices, such as personal computers

- Time Synchronization with atomic clock once a day to ensure optimal data quality
- Application Current Control twice a day
- Forecast for Battery-Change implemented
- Energy Bypass so that Date and Time are maintained even when changing battery
- Hyperterminal Output to get real-time data in the field
