# Configuration Variables in config.txt:

# RFID_TYPE [SR, LR]

#   RFID reader device type: SR is Short Range reader, LR is Long Range reader.
#   If no type is specified (i.e. the variable is #-commented), the associated
#   logic will not be activated.


# RFID_POWER [UA1, UA2]
#   RFID reader power source, must be set to UA1 or UA2.
#   If no value is specified (i.e. the variable is #-commented), the associated
#   logic will not be activated.

# RFID_DETECT_TIMEOUT [s]
#   Duration in seconds measured from the trigger, i.e. when the light barrier
#   filter output gets active or a transponder has been read already.
#   Within this period, the system tries to identify the bird by its
#   transponder ID.  If no transponder is detected, the bird is treated
#   as UNKNOWN and the feeder usually will be closed.


# LB_FILTER_DURATION [s]
#   Light barrier (LB) filter duration in seconds. The LB may change its
#   state several times during a bird is picking food.  To prevent the
#   underlying logic from assuming each time "a new bird", this filter has
#   been implemented.  The duration starts whenever the LB turns to inactive
#   state, i.e. no object is detected any more. When the LB returns active

#   before this time is over, this event will be ignored.  Timing diagram:
#                         ____        __

#     LB activity  :  ___/    \______/  \______________________________
#                         ____________________________
#     Filter Output:  ___/              |------t------\________________
#
#   A value of 0 disables the filter.

# ON_TIME_1, OFF_TIME_1 [hour:min] MEZ
#   These variable determines the on and off time of the MOMO_AUDIO.
#   When it is in the off state, RFID Reader and Soundmodul is switched off
#   , light barriers are switched on.

# AUDIO_POWER [UA1, UA2]
#   AUDIO module power source, must be set to UA1 or UA2.
#   If no value is specified (i.e. the variable is #-commented),
#   the associated logic will not be activated.

# AUDIO_CFG_XX
#   Configuration values for the audio module FN-RM01 Audio Recorder
#   and Player Module, see reference "Audio_Modul.pdf".
#   Currently following parameters are supported:
#   4.3.9  Volume control
#          VC - Volume control
#          Parameter 30: default volume
#          There are total of 31 volume levels,
#          Level 1 is mute while level 31 is the maximum volume.
#   4.3.13 Choose a storage device(µSD Card or USB flash drive)
#          to work with the module
#          ST - Storage Device:
#          Parameter 0:shift to SD card(by default)
#                    1:shift to USB flash drive
#   4.3.14 Choose audio-recording input mode  Connection for MIC recording
#          IM - Input Mode:
#          Parameter 0:connect with MIC (by default)
#                    1:connect with LINE-IN
#                    2:connect wit 2-channel Aux-in
#   4.3.15 Set audio-recording quality(bit rate)
#          RQ - Recording Quality:
#          Parameter 0: 128kbps(by default)
#                    1: 96kbps
#                    2: 64kbps
#                    3: 32kbps


# AUDIO PLAYBACK setting [s]
#   Default duration in seconds.

# AUDIO RECORD setting [s]
#   Default duration in seconds.



# AUDIO PLAYBACK_TYPE  [1,2,3,4,5; 6,7,8,9]
#   Playback files not random: P001.x, P002.x, P003.x, P004.x and P005.x. [1,2,3,4,5]
#   Playback_Type      random: [6,7,8,9].
#   random, [6] for P001.x and P002.x over duration playback in seconds.
#   random, [9] for P001.wav,P002.wav,P003.wav,P004.wav and P005.wav over duration playback in seconds.


# RF - ID : Audio module
#   Transponder ID and optional parameters.
#   ID = 0123456789012345:{playback}:{record}:{playback_type}
#
#   Fields may be left empty to use default values, for example

#   ID = 9E1CE7D001AF0001:1:: but uses the default settings for PLAYBACK, RECORD and PLAYBACK_TYPE.
#   There are two special IDs: "ANY" means there was a transponder detected,
#   but its ID is not listed in this file.  "UNKNOWN" means that NO transponder
#   could be detected within RFID_DETECT_TIMEOUT.
#
#   Please copy on Audio module mikroSD-Card 5 files:
#   P001.wav/mp3, P002.wav/mp3, P003.wav/mp3, P004.wav/mp3 and P005.wav/mp3
#   Total file numbers 5.

#
#   The file Rxxx will be incremented (R+++). R001.wav/mp3 to R999.wav/mp3.
#   Total file numbers 7.
#   Means there are R001.wav/mp3 and R002.wav/mp3 on Audio module mikroSD-Card.
#   Next record file will be R003.wav/mp3
